# Revenue Dashboard

This is a simple dashboard with some graphs that I built from looking at a markup that I found on css tricks. I built it using React with Victory.js for the charts and flexbox for the layout of the page. The purpose of the project was to test my front-end development skills and as a challenge for myself. You can view the project at revenue-dashboard.surge.sh. Here are some screenshots of the project.

# Mobile Version
I built a small mobile dropdown for the site as well.
